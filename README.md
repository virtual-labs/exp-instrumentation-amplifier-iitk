### About the Experiment 

An Instrumentation amplifier is an integrated circuit (IC) that is used to Amplify a signal. This type of
amplifier is in the differential amplifier family because It amplifies the difference between two inputs.
The importance of an Instrumentation amplifier is that it can reduce unwanted noise that is picked up by
The circuit.

Instrumentation Amplifier Design: <br>

An instrumentation amplifier is a combination of 3 typical amplifiers. They are connected in a specific
order to build an instrumentation amplifier. We can segregate the instrument amplifier design into two-
part.<br>
  
Conclusion:<br>

The instrumentation amplifier is designed and constructed and the output value was checked With
theoretical calculation.<br>
